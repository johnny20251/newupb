                It was 2 AM on a Tuesday night when the first lines of "Under Your Skin" came to me. I was sitting 
                in my bedroom studio, guitar in hand, feeling overwhelmed by everything that had been happening in my life. 
                The pressure of growing up in the spotlight, the expectations, the constant scrutiny – it all felt like 
                it was getting under my skin, quite literally.
              </p>

              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The song started as a whisper, almost like a confession to myself. I began with the melody, something 
                haunting yet beautiful, that captured the feeling of being exposed and vulnerable. The lyrics flowed 
                naturally from there – "You get under my skin, like a tattoo that won't fade, marking every part of me 
                with memories we made."
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The Writing Process</h2>
              
              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                What makes "Under Your Skin" special to me is how honest it is. I didn't try to hide behind metaphors 
                or clever wordplay. Instead, I let myself be completely vulnerable, writing about the fear of letting 
                someone see all of you – the good, the bad, and everything in between.
              </p>

              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Working with my producers Oak Felder and Tommy Brown was incredible. They understood the emotional weight 
                Working with my producers Oak Felder and Sebastian Cole was incredible. They understood the emotional weight 
                of the song and helped me create a soundscape that matched the intensity of the lyrics. We spent hours
                perfecting every detail, from the subtle strings in the bridge to the way my voice breaks slightly on 
                the final chorus.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">Finding My Voice</h2>
              
              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                At 17, I'm still figuring out who I am, and this song represents a major step in that journey. It's 
                about accepting that being vulnerable isn't a weakness – it's actually where our greatest strength lies. 
                When we allow ourselves to be truly seen, that's when real connection happens.
              </p>

              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The recording process was emotional. There were moments when I had to stop and take a breath because 
                the lyrics hit too close to home. But that's exactly what made the performance authentic. You can hear 
                the raw emotion in every note, every breath, every pause.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">The Response</h2>
              
              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Since releasing "Under Your Skin," I've been overwhelmed by the response from fans. So many people have 
                shared their own stories of vulnerability and connection. It's incredible to know that something so 
                personal to me can resonate with others and help them feel less alone.
              </p>

              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The song has already reached over 186,000 streams on Spotify, and the music video has been viewed 
                millions of times on YouTube. But beyond the numbers, what matters most to me are the messages from 
                fans saying the song helped them through difficult times or gave them the courage to be more open 
                with the people they love.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-8">What's Next</h2>
              
              <p className="text-white/90 leading-relaxed">
                "Under Your Skin" is just the beginning. I'm working on more music that explores these themes of 
                vulnerability, growth, and self-discovery. Each song is a piece of my journey, and I can't wait to 
                share more of my story with you. Thank you for listening, for connecting, and for letting my music 
                get under your skin too.
